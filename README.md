This repository contains benchmark tests comparing the performance of **FireDucks** (a high-performance single-machine engine) and **Apache Spark** (distributed processing) for different data analytics workloads.

## üî• Key Findings

| Metric               | FireDucks (10GB) | Spark (10GB) | Spark (100GB) |
|----------------------|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Read Time**        | 2s               | 15s          | 25s           |
| **GroupBy Time**     | 5s               | 20s          | 35s           |
| **Memory Usage**     | 1.2GB            | 3GB          | 8GB/node      |
| **Setup Overhead**   | None             | 20s          | 20s           |

**Conclusion**: FireDucks outperforms Spark on single-machine workloads, while Spark scales better for distributed data.
